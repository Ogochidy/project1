        <p>I have a mantra that says ,<em>"Live everyday like it's your last"</em>. But can we really do that?<br>
            It's easy to spit out lines without thinking, especially when we feel it makes sense. But I realized something of late, life doesn't have any particular manual. And unlike your favorite best seller novel, you are writing your own story daily and will only finish it when you are 6-feet below.<br>
            Anyways, in my many years on earth, i think i just started living. Mind you, I'm still figuring myself out. <br>
            OK! I know what you are probably thinking right now. Yes! I'm about to drop that motivational quote.<br>
            Just do you because nobody really cares. I bet you understand that it's your life and not their's.
